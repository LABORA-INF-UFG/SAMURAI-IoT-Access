# SAMURAI-IoT-Access
This repository describes steps for installing the elements that make up SAMURAI-IoT-Access (UE-non3GPP + N3IWF + Free5gc). The installation process involves 3 different machines 1st responsible for running 5GC, 2nd responsible for running N3IWF and 3rd responsible for running UE-non3GPP. The main objective is to provide communication with IoT devices and the 5G core.

#### 5GC environment
* SO: Ubuntu 20.04 (LTS) x64
* Uname -r: >= 5.4.0-122-generic
* Memory: 4 GB
* Disk: 80 GB

#### N3IWF environment
* SO: Ubuntu 20.04 (LTS) x64
* Memory: 2 GB
* Disk: 20 GB

#### UE-non3GPP environment
* SO: Ubuntu 20.04 (LTS) x64
* Memory: 2 GB
* Disk: 20 GB

## SAMURAI-IoT-Access components installation
The installation steps for each of the 3 components are described below. 
**Attention: All installation steps described below must be performed with root privileges (SUDO SU).**


#### 1ยบ 5GC (Free5gc)
Access via terminal the machine where the 5GC will be executed. 
Install python + git + ansible:
```
sudo apt update && apt -y install python && sudo apt -y install git && sudo apt -y install ansible
```

Clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/LABORA-INF-UFG/SAMURAI-IoT-Access.git
```

Install GOLang 1.14.4:
```
cd SAMURAI-IoT-Access &&  ansible-playbook -K golang-install.yml
source ~/.bashrc
```

Run ```ifconfig``` and get the name of **internet network interface**, that provides to the host with access to the internet, like as illustrated in the figure below:
